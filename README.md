This is the worlds most pointless MUD.

***More Coolness Coming Soon***

##Building

Bulding the MUD requires Maven.
Bulding it is then done by running `mvn` in the projects root folder.
The runnable file will then be `target/MUD.jar`.

##Running

It can be started as a server by running this command:
`java -jar MUD.jar server`
